/* About this project:
 * This is a mini project to replicate a simple aircraft performance calculator.
 * The goal of this mini project is to make use of different conditional statements and data types I have learned so far.
 * Implementing these different tools as much as possible through different logical functions to complete the task.
 * Plan:
 * The plan for this project is to initially take in various inputs from the user and read the information back,
 * such as a selection of aircraft type, weight (passengers + baggage + fuel), fuel on board etc.
